# lostandfound
This ASP.NET MVC project is targeted towards schools and their online service to search for lost property and post information about found property. 

Most schools offer an online search mechanism for Lost Property, if they cannot identify and contact the owner of a property that has been found or turned in. Most of the time, students can also post found items. Unclaimed items may be auctioned or discarded and are disposed of after a certain amount of time. 

The online search is a very common functionality and it mainly consists of an entry form and instructions for further action, such as filing an official report for lost items, contact information etc. The same goes for the post functionality, which requests information about the found item's location, date, time, etc. 

The Lost and Found ASP.NET MVC project is intended to be a standardized Lost and Found web solution for schools. Schools will be able to tailor this solution based on their needs and customize the data, theme and the source.
